# Multi-Warehouse Inventory System

This project demonstrates a smart contract for managing inventories across multiple warehouses. The guide below will help you set up the environment and run this project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache
- MetaMask Extension for your browser

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Installing Node.js

1. Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

   node -v
   npm -v

### 2. Installing Truffle

Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum that simplifies the process of compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.

1. Install Truffle globally using npm:

   npm install -g truffle

2. Verify the installation:

   truffle version

### 3. Installing Ganache

Ganache is a local Ethereum blockchain used for development and testing purposes.

1. Download Ganache from the [official website](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
2. Launch Ganache and start a new workspace.
3. To integrate Ganache with VS Code, make sure your Ganache network settings (RPC server and port) match the configuration in your Truffle project (`truffle-config.js`).

**Commands to Verify Ganache Installation**:

- Run Ganache and ensure it's active.
- Use the following command to confirm that Truffle is connected to Ganache:

  truffle networks

### 4. Installing MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension that acts as a wallet and allows interaction with Ethereum networks.

1. Install MetaMask from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).
2. Create or import an account:

   - **Import Account**: Use the private key of one of the accounts generated by Ganache.
   - **Create Account**: Follow MetaMask's setup instructions.

3. Connect MetaMask to Ganache:
   - Open MetaMask, go to "Networks" > "Add Network".
   - Add the following details:
     - **Network Name**: Ganache Local
     - **New RPC URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:7545` (default Ganache RPC server)
     - **Chain ID**: 1337 (or the chain ID shown in Ganache)
   - Save and switch to this network.

## Running the Project

1. **Initialize a Truffle Project**:

   truffle init

   This creates the necessary folder structure (`contracts`, `migrations`, `test`, etc.) for your project.

2. **Add the Smart Contract**:

   - Place your `.sol` file (e.g., `MultiWarehouseInventory.sol`) in the `contracts` folder.

3. **Compile the Contract**:

   truffle compile

4. **Migrate the Contract**:
   truffle migrate --network development

5. **Add Tests**:

   - Create a `test.js` file inside the `test` folder.
   - Write your test cases for the smart contract.

6. **Test the Contract**:
   truffle test

7. **Front - end**:

Add contract address and relevent abi in "App.js".

## Useful Commands

- **Check Node.js version**:

  node -v

- **Check npm version**:

  npm -v

- **Check Truffle version**:

  truffle version

- **Start Ganache**:
  Launch the Ganache application and ensure it's running.

## MetaMask Account Management

### Import Account from Ganache

1. Copy the private key of an account from Ganache.
2. Open MetaMask and select "Import Account."
3. Paste the private key and click "Import."

### Create a New Account in MetaMask

1. In MetaMask, click your profile picture in the top-right corner.
2. Select "Create Account."
3. Follow the instructions to generate a new account.

## Notes

- Ensure your `truffle-config.js` file is properly configured to match the Ganache RPC server.
- Use the same network settings in both Truffle and MetaMask for seamless interaction.
